# Code and data behind my stories on Katadata

This repo contains the code and data behind the analysis and graphics for my stories on [Katadata](https://katadata.co.id/analisisdata). (This is very similar to my [jakpost-graphics repo](https://github.com/dzulfiqarfr/jakpost-graphics).)


## Project organization

I organized this repo by year and then by story (or project). The story directories are stored in chronological order by publication date.

In each story directory, you'll find mostly four subdirectories, namely data, doc, src and result. The contents of each subdirectory are as follows:  
- data: data (both raw and cleaned) for analysis;  
- doc: documents, including PDFs that contain tables or technical notes on the analysis;  
- src: code to analyze the data and visualize the results; and  
- result: analysis results in CSVs and graphics in SVGs and/or PNGs.


## Tools

I use mostly R to wrangle and analyze the data and Datawrapper to visualize the analysis result.


## License

I publish the code in this repo under the [MIT license](LICENSE). The data and graphics produced using the code are published under the [CC-BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode).

I will really appreciate it if you let me know when you use the code, data or graphics.
